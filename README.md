## d)
My bot (sarah_bot) upvotes comments mentioning my favorite candidate (+1), it upvotes submissions mentioning my candidate (+1), it upvotes/downvotes submissions based on positive and negative sentiment on my candidate (+2) (based on their polarity sentiment), and it replies to high upvoted comments before it replies to another comments (+1). I have a minimum of 100 comments (+2), I completed each of the main tasks from the homework (+12), and I created the github repo (+2), in total, my score should be 21/20 points.
